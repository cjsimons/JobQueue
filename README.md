# JobQueue
Python code to handle asynchronous process control

The code reads in either a text file of single line commands or one command at a time and runs them on a predetermined number of cores. 

Still in progress
The number of concurrent processes should be added as an input in the GUI
Functionality to change order or job list, or remove items needs to be added.
